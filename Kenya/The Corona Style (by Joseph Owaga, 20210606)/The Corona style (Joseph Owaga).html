i. Who could ever imagine this... everyone behind a face mask. Everybody resembled a doctor on it’s own.

ii. Failure to have the face mask became an offense payable by forced quarantine, after a bond of $5.

iii. At first the prices of the face mask threatened many as only the 'few' could manage to buy then however, it became cheap afterwards as it flooded into the market in large numbers.

iv. Many people were grefull for the mask for it not only helped to reduce the spread of Covid 19 but also other diseases.

v. The worst part now came, most of the mask were not biodegradable and this pilled lots of trash in the environment, both in water and on land.

<h3>SOCIAL DISTANCE TIPS THAT WERE SET BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH</h3>

• When going out in public, it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from other people and wear a mask to slow the spread of COVID-19. Consider the following tips for practicing social distancing when you decide to go out.

• Know Before You Go: Before going out, know and follow the guidance from local public health authorities where you live.

• Prepare for Transportation: Consider social distancing options to travel safely when running errands or commuting to and from work, whether walking, bicycling, wheelchair rolling, or using public transit, rideshares, or taxis. When using public transit, try to keep at least 6 feet from other passengers or transit operators – for example, when you are waiting at a bus station or selecting seats on a bus or train. When using rideshares or taxis, avoid pooled rides where multiple passengers are picked up, and sit in the back seat in larger vehicles so you can remain at least 6 feet away from the driver.
